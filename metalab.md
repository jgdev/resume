### Child Mind Institute

The Child Mind Institute is a global nonprofit working to transform children’s mental health.

During my time at The Child Mind Institute, I played an integral role in enhancing their open-source platform aimed at supporting mental health initiatives. I contributed both to the web and mobile components of the project, leveraging my expertise in React and React Native.

#### Key Contributions:

- **Feature Development**: Developed and integrated new features that improved user experience, streamlined workflows, and supported mental health resources on both web and mobile platforms. This included user interface improvements, interactive features, and accessibility enhancements. Ensured all new features were thoroughly tested and aligned with the project’s goals of improving accessibility and engagement for users, especially for families and caregivers seeking mental health resources.

- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized both the web and mobile applications for faster load times and smoother interactions, particularly for users with limited bandwidth or slower devices. Leveraged tools such as React’s Virtual DOM and React Native’s performance profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and improve responsiveness.

- **Code Refactoring & Maintenance**: Refactored and modularized legacy code to improve readability, maintainability, and scalability. Contributed to the overall architecture of the platform, ensuring that future enhancements would be easier to integrate.

- **Cross-Platform Synchronization**: Worked on ensuring seamless data synchronization between the web and mobile platforms, so that users could easily switch between devices without losing progress or data.

- **Collaboration & Open-Source Community Engagement**: Actively collaborated with cross-functional teams, including designers, product managers, and other developers to ensure that the platform met both technical and user needs. Contributed to the open-source nature of the project by documenting code and engaging with the community. This included writing detailed technical documentation, responding to issues and pull requests, and helping onboard new contributors.

- **User-Centric Design**: Focused on building user-centric features that made mental health resources more accessible. This included features like customized content recommendations, easy navigation, and real-time support chat options.
